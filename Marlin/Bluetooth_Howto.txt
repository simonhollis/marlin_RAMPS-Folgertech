Configuring HC06 bluetooth module:

1) Swap RX & TX wires on the bluetooth module for programming.
2) Program a blank program to the Arduino
3) Connect the HC06

4) Open up Serial Monitor in the Arduino tool
5) Select current BT module bitrate (default 9600) and line endings to None
6) Close Serial Monitor
7) Pull USB connection and power cycle Arduino
8) Re-power, re-connect and Re-open Serial Monitor with new bitrate
9) Start typing e.g.

AT -> OK
AT+NAMEPrusa_i3 -> OKsetname
AT+PIN9071 -> OKsetpin
AT+BAUD8 -> OK115200

Note: 115200 is the fastest that Windows can support (really :( 
So, don't program any faster, or it is difficult to reset the baudrate.
